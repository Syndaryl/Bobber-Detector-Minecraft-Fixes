# Bobber-Detector-Minecraft
A bobber detector for Minecraft Forge 1.19.2.

Adds a simple block that detects when a fish is caught and outputs a redstone signal. 
Additionally the block lights up at the top and bottom whenever a bobber is detected in the search area.
The search area is a 5x5x5 cube in front of the block.

Requires create 0.5.1.a or higher

Created to be used together with Create's deployer to create automatic fish farms.

Due to personal reasons i will not have the time to develop the mod further in the foreseeable future.
If you want to improve it / fix bugs or update to new versions i will gladly test and publish the fixes for others to enjoy.
